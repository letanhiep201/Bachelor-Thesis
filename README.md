## Objectives
This study investigates the perceptions of English-major students and EFL instructors at Ton Duc Thang University (TDTU) regarding TikTok's role in enhancing English-speaking skills. Specifically, it explores:

- Students' perceptions of how TikTok supports their English-speaking skills, including pronunciation, fluency, and speaking confidence, and whether they perceive it as an effective learning tool.
- Teachers' perceptions on the potential advantages and challenges of using TikTok in improving students' English-speaking skills compared to traditional teaching methods.

## Scope of the Study
- This study focuses on English-major students at TDTU and EFL teachers at the university.
- It explores their perceptions of using TikTok for speaking skills enhancement through surveys and interviews.
- The study employs a mixed-methods approach to provide both quantitative and qualitative insights.

## Methods
A *mixed-methods* approach was used, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection:

- **Survey responses:** A *questionnaire* was administered to English-major students at TDTU to gather quantitative data on their perceptions of using TikTok for speaking practice.
- **Interviews:** *Semi-structured interviews* were conducted with EFL instructors to explore their perspectives in depth.
- **Data analysis:**
  - Quantitative data were analyzed using *descriptive statistics* (frequencies and percentages).
  - Qualitative data were processed through *thematic analysis* to identify key themes in studentsâ€™ and teachersâ€™ responses.
